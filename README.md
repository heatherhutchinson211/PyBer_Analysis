# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
The PyBer_Analysis project aims to analyze ride-sharing data from the provided files, [city_data.csv] and [ride_data.csv]. Using Python and the Pandas library, the analysis involves creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Additionally, with the help of Pandas and Matplotlib, a multiple-line graph is generated to visualize the total weekly fares for each city type. The project concludes with a written report summarizing the differences in data across city types and how these differences can inform decision-making at PyBer.
## Results

The analysis of the ride-sharing data revealed the following key findings:

- The combined data from 2019 showed that urban cities had the highest number of rides and fares, followed by suburban and rural cities. Urban cities also had a significantly higher number of drivers. However, the average fare per ride and average fare per driver were lower in urban areas compared to suburban and rural areas.

- The line chart representing the total fares per city type on a weekly basis from January to April 2019 demonstrated that urban cities consistently had the highest fare totals each week, followed by suburban and rural cities. Notably, all city types exhibited similar peak and dip patterns.

- The visualization depicting the relationship between ride fare and the number of rides in each city type showcased that rides tended to be cheaper in urban areas, resulting in a higher volume of rides in those locations.

- The pie charts illustrating the total number of fares, rides, and drivers by city type indicated that urban cities had the largest share in each category, followed by suburban and rural cities.

## Summary
Here are some reccommendations I have for a CEO interested in making changes based on this analysis.  

First, it seems that having more drivers keeps fare prices lower for citizens using ridesharing apps.  This trend could also be due to rides being shorter in these urban areas; however, it is something to keep in mind. 

Also, it seems that each type of city had a significant peak in total rides towards the end of Februrary and the beginning of April.  Perhaps offering some kind of ride promotion would enable more rides during other months of the year.

Finally, as rural cities seemed to have the least amount of total fares across the board.  It might be beneficial to again either offer promotions to people living in these areas, or increase marketing to these citizens in order to promote using these ridesharing companies as transportation more frequently.
