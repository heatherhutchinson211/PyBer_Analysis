# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to look at ride-sharing data from the files [city_data.csv] and [ride_data.csv], and to calculate averages and create visualiations based on the data.  These two files were combined into a single data frame before analysis begun.  The files included information from the year 2019, regarding drivers per city, city type, fares for each ride, and the dates these rides were taken. 

## Results
Using the provided data, I calculated total rides in the year 2019, total drivers, toal fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver based on each city type: Urban, Suburban, and Rural. I then combined this data into a single data frame as shown here :

It is clear that there was a significantly higher amount of rides taken in Urban cities, resulting in a significantly higher fare total.  Suburban cities had the next highest total of rides and fare totals, with rural cities coming in last. The number of drivers in Urban cities was also significantly higher; however, average fares per ride and average fares per driver were much lower than in suburban and rural cities. 

I then made some new analysis on total fares per city type, weekly, from January to April of 2019.  I represented this data visually using a line chart as shown below.

As you can see here, Urban cities had the highest fare totals each week, then Suburban followed by Rural. However, it is interesting to see that each city type had common peaks and dips.

## Summary
Here are some reccommendations I have for a CEO interested in making changes based on this analysis.  

First, it seems that having more drivers keeps fare prices lower for citizens using ridesharing apps.  This trend could also be due to rides being shorter in these urban areas; however, it is something to keep in mind. 

Also, it seems that each type of city had a significant peak in total rides towards the end of Februrary and the beginning of April.  Perhaps offering some kind of ride promotion would enable more rides during other months of the year.

Finally, as rural cities seemed to have the least amount of total fares across the board.  It might be beneficial to again either offer promotions to people living in these areas, or increase marketing to these citizens in order to promote using these ridesharing companies as transportation more frequently.
