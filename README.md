# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
The prupose of this analysis was to look at ride-sharing data from the files [city_data.csv] and [ride_data.csv], and to calculate averages and create visualiations based on the data.  These two files were combined into a single data frame before analysis begun.  The files included information from the year 2019, regarding drivers per city, city type, fares for each ride, and the dates these rides were taken. 

## Results
Using the provided data, I calculated total rides in the year 2019, total drivers, toal fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver based on each city type: Urban, Suburban, and Rural. I then combined this data into a single data frame as shown here :

It is clear that there was a significantly higher amount of rides taken in Urban cities, resulting in a significantly higher fare total.  Suburban cities had the next highest total of rides and fare totals, with rural cities coming in last. The number of drivers in Urban cities was also significantly higher; however, average fares per ride and average fares per driver were much lower than in suburban and rural cities. 

I then made some new analysis on total fares per city type, weekly, from January to April of 2019.  I represented this data visually using a line chart as shown below.
