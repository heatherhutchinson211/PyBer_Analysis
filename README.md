# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Project
The prupose of this analysis was to look at ride-sharing data from the files [city_data.csv] and [ride_data.csv], and to calculate averages and create visualiations based on the data.  These two files were combined into a single data frame before analysis begun.  The files included information from the year 2019, regarding drivers per city, city type, fares for each ride, and the dates these rides were taken.
